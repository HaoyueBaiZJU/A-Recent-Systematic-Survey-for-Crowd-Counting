# CNN-based Single Image Crowd Counting: Network Design, Loss Function, and Supervisory Signal

Single image crowd counting is a challenging computer vision problem with wide applications in public safety, city planning, traffic management, etc. This survey is to provide a comprehensive summary of recent advanced crowd counting techniques based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) via density map estimation. Our goals are to provide an up-to-date review of recent approaches, and educate new researchers in this field the design principles and trade-offs.

## Introduction

#### Crowd counting techniques applied in different domains

- Privacy preserving crowd monitoring: Counting people without people models or tracking [paper](http://visal.cs.cityu.edu.hk/static/pubs/conf/cvpr08-peoplecnt.pdf)
- Learning to count objects in images [paper](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2010/file/fe73f687e5bc5280214e0486b273a5f9-Paper.pdf)
- Towards perspective-free object counting with deep learning [paper](http://agamenon.tsc.uah.es/Personales/rlopez/docs/eccv2016-onoro.pdf)
