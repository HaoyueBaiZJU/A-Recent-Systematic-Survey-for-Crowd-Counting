# CNN-based Single Image Crowd Counting: Network Design, Loss Function, and Supervisory Signal

Single image crowd counting is a challenging computer vision problem with wide applications in public safety, city planning, traffic management, etc. This survey is to provide a comprehensive summary of recent advanced crowd counting techniques based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) via density map estimation. Our goals are to provide an up-to-date review of recent approaches, and educate new researchers in this field the design principles and trade-offs.
